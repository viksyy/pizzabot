When you will download the .zip file of project I suggest to import in Eclipse as an “Existing Project Into Workspace”.
After this you should find the .zip file of project in “Select archive file:” input.
Next step is to click Finish and project is imported in your IDE.
The last step is importing the “JUnit Library” by pressing right click on a project -> Build Path -> Configure Build Path...
I this step you’ll see the wizard an you should click on “Add Library…“ button and select JUnit from the suggested list.
Then click Next and Finish. After this you should click OK button and project is ready for use.

In my project are visible 4 Classes. You should start Pizzabot.java class and everything will be visible in console.
